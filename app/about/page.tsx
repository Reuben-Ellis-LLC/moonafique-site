          <div className="prose prose-lg text-muted-foreground">
            <p>
              Moonafique was born from a passion for 3D printing and a love for
              creating unique, high-quality pieces that bring joy to collectors
              and enthusiasts alike. What started as a small workshop has grown
              into a thriving business dedicated to pushing the boundaries of
              what&apos;s possible with 3D printing technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our journey began when our founder, a lifelong 3D printing
              enthusiast, noticed a gap in the market for premium-quality,
              detailed 3D printed collectibles. Combining technical expertise
              with artistic vision, we set out to create pieces that not only
              look stunning but also stand the test of time.
